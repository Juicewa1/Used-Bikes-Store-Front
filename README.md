# Used-Bikes-Store-Front
Developed a Used Bike Storefront that allowed you to interact with the items, select items, add items to the cart, make payments using different payment selections, 
and receive change if used cash. This program keeps track of the total of purchases. It provides a user-friendly experience to customers for buying products from the Bike Store.
